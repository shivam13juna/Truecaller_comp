    "\"\"\"`Branding\n",
    "One of the most critical and basic long-term objectives of marketing is to brand your company or product. This is the use of promotional techniques to create a particular reputation that resonates with target customers. Lexus has developed itself as a luxury and status car brand for people with upper-middle to upper class incomes. Target is a value-oriented retailer of fashion, apparel and home goods. Wal-Mart has built its brand on low prices. Regardless of the image, consumers prefer to purchase products and services that offer a clear value proposition as opposed to ones with uncertainty or mixed messages.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Research\n",
    "Market research is key to increasing brand preferences, as the more you understand about what motivates your customers the easier it is to appeal to them. Getting to know the core beliefs that your products carry into the marketplace is especially useful. For instance, customers who buy high-end fashions generally expect to get a high level of service and to pay a premium price. Understanding this helps you to better tailor your offering to present good benefits and earn reasonable profit.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Emphasize Benefits\n",
    "Turning a habitual or routine buyer into an emotionally attached, loyal customer with a strong brand preference is largely based on the customer's sense of value. Understanding your target market's preferred product or service features and benefits helps you optimize your offering and promote a product concept that meshes with the market's interest. As a premium coffee shop, for instance, your customers may prefer benefits such as taste quality, premium coffee beans, and fast customer service.`\n",
    "\n",
    "`Engagement\n",
    "\"Engagement\" has become a hot buzz word in early 21st century brand development. This is the use of more direct, interactive forms of communication with customers. Personal selling, email and and telemarketing are common, traditional forms of interpersonal communication. Social media, such as Twitter and Facebook, have significantly broadened the concept and importance of brand engagement. Customers move quickly and exchange experiences with others in these real-time social venues. Having a presence in the social media realm helps you directly engage customers and address negative discussions that could impact your brand's word-of-mouth.`\"\"\"\n",
